# Facial_Expression_Recognition
Facial Expression Recognition Using OpenCV:
A real-time facial expression recognition system developed using Python, OpenCV, and Jupyter Notebook. This project captures live video from the webcam, detects faces using Haar Cascade Classifier, and classifies human emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, and more. Detected expressions are visualized with corresponding emojis for an interactive user experience.

Features:
-> Real-time face detection and emotion classification
-> Visual representation of expressions using emojis
-> Trained deep learning model for accurate predictions
-> User-friendly and interactive interface
